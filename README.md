# simple-redirect

A simple container to redirect traffic to another server, based on `nginx:mainline-alpine`.

I built this to use inside a kubernetes cluster to route `www.example.com/<path>` to
`example.com/<path>` 

Simple Redirect requires a single environment variable `REDIRECT_SERVER` which is the server
to redirect to. The original scheme and path of the request are maintained.
